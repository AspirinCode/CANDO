    "In this step we will generate a matrix of 2,162 drugs by 64 proteins, populated with the corresponding interaction score betwen each drug and protein. The final matrix will have drugs as the columns (indexed according to the compound mapping file), and proteins as the indices (indexed by PDB and chain ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_matrix()` first creates a dataframe for all tanimoto scores comparing each drug in our dataset (2,162) to every potential binding site ligand from the PDB, `cmpd_scores`. Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in our dataset (example set = 64 proteins) with the corresponding binding site score, `prot_scores`. The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the highest tanimoto score. These scores represent how strongly each drug may potentially bind to each protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, `matrix_file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is parallelized, so setting the vairable `ncpus` will change the number of processors that are used for this function."

This can be relatively time consuming depending on the amount of proteins, but with proteins on the order of hundreds it shouldn't take longer than a minute or two. If the computation does take a while (let's say >100,000 proteins), you can add a `save_rmsds='name_of_rmsd_file.tsv'` flag to save the computation.

To do this, we hold out each compound and look for any of the other approved compounds within a certain cutoff of the `Compound.similar` list for the held-out compound. The cutoffs are predetermined to be top10, top25, top50, and top100. There are also percent cutoffs that vary based on the number of compounds in the platform. So, for Indication-A with three drugs approved (D1, D2, and D3), we would hold out D1 and look for *either* D2 or D3 in the top10, top25, top50, and top100 compounds to D1. This would be repeated for D2 and D3. So let's say D3 was recaptured at rank 5 for D1, D1 was recaptured at rank 12 for D2, and D1 was recaptured at rank 27 for D3. The top10 average indication accuracy would be (1+0+0) / 3 == 33%, whereas the top25 would be (1+1+0) / 3 == 66%, and the top50 would be 100%. \n",

Instead of generating a new matrix with all of these proteins and their corresponding interaction values, which can begin to take up a lot of storage if done multiple times, the `'protein_set='` flag can be specified during the instantiation of the CANDO object. This flag contains the path to the protein subset the user wishes to use, which is simply a list of UniProt protein IDs. The CANDO object will automatically check for each ID if it either simply matches any UniProt IDs within the matrix or if that UniProt ID is associated with any PDB chains within the matrix (based on a mapping from the SIFTs project). If there are matches, the CANDO object will now contain Compound objects with only those protein interaction values in their signatures. Below is an example with encompanying benchmark and ML examples. Let's check to see if some of the 20 UniProt IDs in the example list had correspnding PDBs. "
